## Introduction

Bot Battlr is a React application that displays a list of available bots and allows users to create their bot army. Users can view profiles of all bots, add individual bots to their army, release bots from their army, and discharge bots forever. Additionally, the app provides sorting and filtering functionalities for the bot list.

## Project Setup

To set up the Bot Battlr application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub: [Link to GitHub Repository](https://github.com/your-username/bot-battlr)
2. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install` in the project directory.
3. Create a `db.json` file in the project directory with the bot data in the format specified in the project guidelines.
4. Start the JSON server by running `json-server --watch db.json --port 8001`.
5. Run the React app by running `npm start`.
6. Open the app in your web browser by visiting `http://localhost:3000`.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following software and tools installed:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- json-server (for the backend data)

## Features

The core features of the Bot Battlr application include:

- Viewing profiles of all bots in the `BotCollection` component.
- Adding an individual bot to your army by clicking on it. The bot is enlisted only once and remains visible in the `BotCollection`.
- Releasing a bot from your army by clicking on it. The bot disappears from the `YourBotArmy` component.
- Discharging a bot from their service forever by clicking the red button marked "x". This action deletes the bot from both the backend and the `YourBotArmy` on the frontend.

Additionally, the app includes the following advanced features:

- Sorting bots by their health, damage, or armor using the `SortBar` component.
- Filtering bots by their class, allowing users to select multiple filters at the same time.
- Enlisting only one bot from each `bot_class`, which includes the classes `["Support", "Medic", "Assault", "Defender", "Captain", "Witch"]`.
